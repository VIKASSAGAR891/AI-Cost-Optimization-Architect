Final Report: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance Insights

1. Use Case Overview
- Use Case: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance Insights
- Industry: Manufacturing
- Business Goal: Enhance operational efficiency by proactively identifying maintenance needs using AI-powered FAQ agents.

Expected Benefits:
- Reduced unplanned downtime
- Faster resolution of vendor and internal queries
- Improved operational visibility through automated alerts

2. Cost Modeling Summary
- Monthly Baseline Cost: $6,100
- Annual Baseline Cost: $73,200

Primary Cost Drivers:
- High-frequency vendor and system queries
- Large model token usage (500+ tokens per interaction)
- 24/7 uptime SLA requirements

Identified Opportunities for Optimization:
- Reduce average prompt length to 300 tokens
- Use moderate-quality, lower-latency models
- Switch to cost-efficient inference providers

3. Agent Design Recommendation
Recommended Model: Amazon Nova Pro
Justification: Offers balanced monthly cost (~$4,860), low latency (190ms), and high-enough quality for high-volume FAQ scenarios like invoice queries and vendor support.

Backup Models:
1. Amazon Titan Text Express – Moderate latency (220ms) and slightly lower cost; suitable for non-critical queries.
2. Bedrock Llama 3 8B – Great for complex QA tasks with good latency and reasoning capabilities.

Excluded Models:
- GPT-4o and Cohere Command R+ – Due to high latency and cost.
- Titan Text Mini – Excluded for insufficient quality in this domain.

4. What-If Simulation Analysis

Scenario:
What if we switch to the Bedrock Claude Haiku model despite slower latency, to improve maintenance insights?

Impact Analysis:

A. Cost Impact
- Previous Monthly Cost: $6,100
- New Monthly Cost: $4,300
- Annual Savings: $21,600 (29.5%)
Commentary: Switching to Claude Haiku significantly lowers costs while maintaining strong model performance.

B. Performance Impact
- Latency: 420ms (vs. 190ms of Nova Pro)
- Quality: High
- Accuracy: Improved for predictive maintenance
Commentary: Latency is slower but acceptable for non-real-time use; higher quality boosts insight precision.

C. Risk Assessment
- Compliance: Unaffected
- Security: No degradation (ISO 27001, RBAC, Audit Logs remain intact)
- Risk Level: Medium
Commentary: Slightly increased risk in time-sensitive scenarios due to latency but manageable overall.

5. Final Recommendation

Proceed with the switch to Bedrock Claude Haiku for improved insight quality and significant cost savings — provided that real-time alerting needs remain within acceptable latency bounds.

Rationale:
- Substantial cost reduction (~$21,600/year)
- Improved predictive insight accuracy
- Latency trade-off is acceptable in non-critical maintenance scenarios

Implementation Tips:
- Continuously monitor system performance for latency-sensitive use cases
- Adjust alerting thresholds or fallback strategies if real-time issues arise
- Consider a hybrid model deployment for high-priority alerts using low-latency models

6. Summary

This multi-agent architecture, with inputs from cost, design, and simulation advisors, confirms that adopting Bedrock Claude Haiku will result in:
- ~30% annual cost savings
- Higher-quality maintenance insights
- Medium operational risk due to increased latency

Recommendation: Adopt Claude Haiku, but monitor system performance and real-time alert needs closely.
